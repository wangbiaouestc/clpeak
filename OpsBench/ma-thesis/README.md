ma-thesis: Michael Andersch's MS thesis
===========

Main repository for my master's thesis about latencies in a throughput processor. Hopefully, once the project is done, this repository will contain several microbenchmarks to determine static latencies from GPU processors and a modified GPGPU-sim simulator. This simulator should 1) emit events whenever a (memory) instruction moves from one execution stage to the next and 2) implement load-store-prioritization.
